## Quick Start guide

### For server owners:

Simply use [an invite link such as this one](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=458431964119040000&scope=bot&permissions=8) or via the `.invite` command on Discord.

Please note that Telephone bot requires the _read messages_, _send messages_, _embed links_, and _attach files_ functions to work.

### For users:

To setup a profile, you'll first need to register by using the `.profile create` command in any channel (or direct message).

From here you can use the respective commands to set your in-game username (`.profile ign`), level (`.profile level`), rank (`.profile rank rm S+0`), etc. You can use the help system to easily list all of the profile related commands (see below).

Almost all commands are organised into what are called <span title="Also known as Cogs.">_modules_</span>. Each module has its own list of commands accessible via the `.help` command.

For example, if you want to know the different profile related commands, you can use `.help profile` in a channel or direct message.
